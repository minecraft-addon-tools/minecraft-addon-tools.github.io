Title: About This Project
---
Our GitHub organization, [bedrock-addon-tools](https://github.com/minecraft-addon-tools) was built and designed in order to encourage the growth of the Minecraft Bedrock Scripting community.

Our goal is to provide the tools that make bedrock scripting:
* Easy
* Less error prone
* Self-documenting

And we want to do this, while still allowing you to code in whatever language feels most natural to you.

We want to provide tutorials to help you learn how to get started, from the very beginning, to more advanced topics, and we'd like to point you towards resources that other members of the community have made.
